# Plot.ly-Homework
Belly Button Biodiversity plotly challenge explores different chart visualizations. This activity provides a dropdown menu to select a Subject ID and presents collected data for each in its demographic info box, bar chart, bubble chart and gauge indicator. 

Data can be viewed through a live server and also touches upon access to CORS data. A samples.json file was provided instead of using a url to look into the data further. 

This challenge is mostly complete and will surely continue to explore.
